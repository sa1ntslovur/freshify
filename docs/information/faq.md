{: .text-blue-100 }

A shift at our store is an opportunity for Assistant Store Managers to host one, during which Team Leaders can potentially receive a promotion provided they don't have an ongoing cooldown period.

### What is a cooldown?

A cooldown period serves to prevent staff from receiving promotions too frequently. For instance, if a staff member was recently promoted in a previous session, they must wait until their cooldown period ends before they can be considered for another promotion in another shift.
