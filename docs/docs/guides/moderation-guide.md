## Appeal
{: .text-blue-100 }

Any moderation actions can be appealed except for permanent bans. To appeal a permanent ban, Executive Management will need to grant permission for you to appeal.

If a permanent ban is deemed unappealable, it means that you cannot request a review of your permanent ban.

### How to Appeal
{: .text-blue-100 }

To appeal, please direct message an Executive Management member. We are currently developing a game where you can appeal your ban or moderation action.
