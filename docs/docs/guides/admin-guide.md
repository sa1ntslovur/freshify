### Admin Information
{: .text-blue-100 }

Freshify employs Adonis and Basic Admin Essentials to manage administrative functions within our games. These systems, along with additional security measures, logging, and anti-abuse protocols, make it difficult to misuse administrator permissions.

### Admin Information: Ranks
{: .text-blue-100 }

| Rank        | Admin Level         |
|:------------|:--------------------|
| Store Supervisor | Moderator | 
| Assistant Store Manager | Moderator |
| Store Manager | Administrator | 
| Operations Manager | Administrator | 
| Store Moderator | Super Admin |
| Store Administrator | Super Admin |
| Head Administrator | Super Admin |
| Contractor | Creator Admin |
| Chief Development Officer | Creator Admin |
| Vice President | Creator Admin |
| President | Creator Admin |
| Chief Operations Officer | Creator Admin |

Command access depends on a user's assigned admin level. For example, Moderators and Administrators cannot use the :pban command, while Super Admins and higher ranks have the necessary permissions.

### Hiding Commands

To hide commands, show the command bar by pressing the ' key on your keyboard or state /e before commands in the chat bar. For instance:

> /e :m Hello!
