## Host & Trainer: Joining
{: .text-blue-100 }

The Host should be joining the server by **:45** and prepare for the training session, which includes lining up and checking that everything is in order.

Trainers should be joining the server by **:50** and lining up on the line behind the Host line.

At **:55**, make sure to unlock the server by saying `:unslock`. Once trainees start to join, you can use the `:welcome` command to show the welcome messages. You can repeat this command a few times, but do not overuse it.

If you encounter any problems during the session, please create a ticket and describe the issue clearly.

## Host: Starting Script & Information 
{: .text-blue-100 }

**At the start of the training, the Host must lock the server by typing :slock in the command bar or /e :slock in the chat bar.** This will prevent any late Trainees from joining.

**The Host must use the :sm command to announce the prompts below in *italic*.** If using the command bar, remove the prefix. It is important to send the next announcement quickly after the previous one closes. **If using the chat, use the command with /e in the front.**

*Welcome to this Freshify Training Session! My name is (username) and I am your Host for today. It’s great to meet you all. Whether you are new or returning, I hope you enjoy this session.*

**Replace "(username)" with your Roblox username.**

*Please pay attention to the training instructions and information that will be shown shortly. Do not chat or distract others during the training instructions. If you are caught being disruptive or disrespectful, you will be removed from the server.*

Now, use the `:traininginfo` command to display the training procedures and important information automatically.

**Trainers can now move to their assigned group to train the trainees during the training instructions.** The Host can use the command `:pm %trainer message` to send a private message to the trainers. **Make sure to hide this command by using /e before it.**

**After the training information and procedure messages are done, please say the following and start teleporting Trainees to their respective groups.**

*You will be moved to your assigned group shortly, so please wait. Trainees are NOT allowed to roam around after being teleported.*

## Trainer: Starting Script
{: .text-red-300 }

When trainees are teleported, start with the script below. **Take your time and don't rush**. If a trainee has a question, let them know to wait until you finish the introduction.

*Welcome to the Freshify Training Session! I’m username, your trainer for today. Please choose a register and wait for my instructions before doing anything else.*

Replace **username** with your Roblox username.

*You will have to take a quiz at the end of this session. You can use the !notepad command to write down notes that will help you with the quiz.*

*Please tell me if you need to go AFK. Otherwise, you will be removed from the server. You can go AFK for up to 2 minutes, and you can do it twice during this training.*

*If you get disconnected, you have 90 seconds to rejoin. If you miss the time, you will have to attend another training session.*

*If I get disconnected, please stay where you are and don’t move around. If I don’t come back, someone else will continue the training.*

*Do you have any questions? If you do, please ask them now. If you don’t, please jump to show me that you’re ready to start.*

If the trainee(s) have any questions, you must answer them. If they don’t, you can continue.

If someone is AFK without telling you, remind them to come back. If they don’t reply, you can remove them from the server with the reason: **Failed**.

## Trainer: Introduction to Cafe Register Script
{: .text-red-300 }

*The cafe at Freshify offers drinks and treats for customers to enjoy. To work in the cafe, you need to learn how to make drinks and operate the register.*

*You can scan the **[JSM] Operator Barcode** on the register to login now. Please wait for me to explain how our system works before you touch anything else.*

*To scan an item, you just need to bring it to the register and it will scan it automatically.*

*If the item disappears from your inventory, it means that it has been scanned by the register.*

*To check, look at the top of the screen to see all the items that have been scanned.*

*If you need to remove an item, click the X next to the item on the top right or click Clear Order to cancel all the items that have been scanned.*

*If you cancel the items accidentally, you have to make the drink again and scan it. This goes same for an item.*

*To let the customer pay, click the Finish Transaction button. Then, ask the customer to tap on the Pin Pad to get their item(s).*

*The customer will receive the items that you scanned automatically after they pay.*

*Now that you have learned the basics of the register, let’s move on to the ordering section.*

*You will have to make the items that I order and scan them at the register. Then, you will let me pay for them.*

**Visit each trainee’s register one by one and order a simple drink item. If they make a mistake, they will not be penalized as they have to take a quiz at the end of the training.**

*Well done, everyone! Let’s go to the Checkout Area next. Please follow me.*

## Trainer: Voiding Transactions & Items Script
{: .text-red-300 }

*We're kicking off the training with the Voiding test. Please choose a register. Pay full attention, as it will be beneficial for you in the end.*

*Freshify features self-checkout systems that simulate a real-life shopping experience. These checkouts work just like actual checkout systems you encounter in real life.*

*In this test, you need to show me how to void items.*

*To void a single item, either press Store Login or scan your barcode. Then, select Cancel Items and press the button next to the item you want to remove.*

*To void a transaction, either press Store Login or scan your barcode. Next, select Void Transaction and then press Yes.*

*Voiding random transactions without reason is not allowed and may result in a warning or demotion.*

*I'll now scan an item on your register. Please be patient as I do so. Don't take any action unless I instruct you to do so.*

*I scanned the item. Now, you will demonstrate to me how to void a SINGLE ITEM. Questions? Just say PTS. No penalties for not knowing. Please wait as I come to your register.*

*Now, let's move on to voiding the transaction. I'll scan an item on your register. Please wait for further instructions before taking any action.*

*I scanned the item on the registers, now it is your turn to show me how to void a TRANSACTION. Questions? Just say PTS. No penalties for not knowing. Please wait as I come to your register.*

*Congratulations! We will now be doing the Item Approval test.*

## Trainer: Item Approval
{: .text-red-300 }

*Now, we'll proceed with the Item Approval test. Please pay full attention.*

*Certain items in the store need staff approval. To handle this, scan your barcode and then press Yes or No on the screen as instructed.*

*To approve a transaction, ask the customer for identification by saying, 'Can I see some identification?' If they provide it, press Store Login, scan your barcode, and then press Yes.*

*To reject a transaction, press Store Login, scan your barcode, and then press No. Make sure to say 'Can I see some identification?' before rejecting it.*

*I'll scan an item on your register. Please be patient as I do so. Follow instructions and refrain from taking any action until directed by me.*

*I scanned the item on the registers, now it is your turn to show me how to ACCEPT a transaction. Questions? Just say PTS. No penalties for not knowing. Please wait as I come to your register.*

*Now, let's move on to denying the transaction. I'll scan an item on your register. Please wait for further instructions before taking any action.*

*I scanned the item on the registers, now it is your turn to show me how to DENY a transaction. Questions? Just say PTS. No penalties for not knowing. Please wait as I come to your register.*

*Congratulations! We will now be doing the Quiz.*

## Trainer: Quiz
{: .text-red-300 }

*I will ask you 3 questions. To pass this training session, you must get at least two out of three right. You can use the notes you wrote to help you.*

Now, you can use the `:pm` command to send questions to the trainees. Make sure the questions are clear and not too hard. Here are some examples:

1. How do you approve a transaction?
2. How do you deny a transaction?
3. As an LR, do you have to use proper grammar at the store or training center?

**Do not show the `:pm` command to anyone.**

**IF THEY PASS:** You have successfully completed today’s training session! Please follow me to the ranking line.

**IF THEY FAIL:** You did not pass the training session. Don’t worry, you can try again in another training session.

The training session is over, and you can shut down the server by saying `:shutdown`.
