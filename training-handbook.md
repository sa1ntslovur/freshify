{: .note-title }
> HANDBOOK INFORMATION
> 
> * This guide is designed for **Store Supervisors and above** to aid them in conducting training sessions for trainees.
> Within the code blocks, you'll find the specific content to be communicated to trainees during the training sessions.
> All other text serves as supplementary information.

## Training Information & Expectations
{: .text-yellow-300 }

* All staff participating in the training should align themselves behind the designated **Host** line. Trainees are expected to stand on the designated **Red** lines.
* **PTS requests will be addressed until :55**. Trainees should direct any questions to their assigned trainer after the PTS requests are denied.
* Trainees are strictly advised against entering the Self Checkout room independently. Only Trainers are authorized to teleport trainees to the Self Checkout room when necessary.
* Training staff MUST hide their commands by either utilizing the command bar or employing "/c system" followed by pressing enter, and subsequently issuing commands there. It's important to note that commands in the command bar do not necessitate a prefix.
* Trainees should strictly adhere to the designated **Red** lines and comply with all specified regulations.
* Beginning at **:55**, trainees are expected to maintain silence and refrain from engaging in any disruptive or conversational activities.
* Any instances of trainees engaging in spamming activities will result in their immediate removal from the server.

{: .warning } 
> Trainers and the Host are required to manually assign their teams by using the command **:team me Host** or **:team me Trainer**. The overhead display will promptly update to reflect the new team name. It is strictly prohibited to form a team with anyone other than a designated Host or Trainer. Additionally, the Host is authorized to assign a Trainer to the Trainer team.

## Training Information: Starting
{: .text-yellow-300 }

When the training commences, the **Host** should **lock** the server to prevent any additional **Trainees** from joining by typing **!slock** in the chat bar. It's important to note that this command will NOT work in the command bar. The **!slock** command, however, does not need to be hidden.

The **Host** is required to say the prompts below, utilizing the **:sm** command to announce them. For command bar functionality, the prefix will be removed. It is crucial to send the next announcement promptly **after a announcement closes**.


```Welcome to this Freshify Training Session! I'm (username), your Host for today's session. It's a pleasure to meet all of you. If this is your first time here, a warm welcome to you, and if you've been here before, welcome back!```

Replace **(username)** with your Roblox username.
